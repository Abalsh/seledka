# Description
This repository is dedicated to a project ... create a guide/manual for ... provide options ... recommend hardware and software solutions ... 
* People, who would like to avoid tracking/spying or be informed about its existence and extent
* People, who are ready to sacrifice comfort in favour of security
* People with "Stallman" diagnosis, willing to ИO TRESPASSINГ!!

## The project consists of several independent parts
* Recommended software, premade images, automated setup scripts etc. Different setups for different user choices that may significantly limit hardware capabilities
* Guides to selecting hardware with explanations and external links. Recommended PC models considering known issues with Intel and AMD processors etc.
* Guidelines to follow when online/offline. Secure passwords, encryption, wiping sensitive data, links to external resources (we don't want to keep PGP manual updated ourselves) etc. A tremendous amount of works, actually.
